      <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my personal site. I believe a personal site gives me
        the control we as a society have lost to mainstream platforms. Despite
        this vast control, I still do not know what to put here 😁. This site is
        very much <em>a work in progress</em>, but I hope to develop it into
        something of which I will be proud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I intend to logically organize everything... once I have something to
        organize. I would like to have a blog, a dedicated projects page, and
        maybe even a games page 😉.

          My name is Demetrius S and I am a 23-year-old college student pursuing
          a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Of course, a computer
          science degree isn't all that I am!

        <section>
          <p>
            Professionally, I work for my University's IT Help Desk. I like my
            job, the people I work with, and the problems I solve. In the most
            likely case, I see myself working in IT rather than SWE, but I do
            still pursue the world of SWE as much as I can. I participate in
            some clubs at University, and I enjoy quite a few hobbies outside of
            my extracurriculars.

        <h3>University Clubs</h3>

          <h4>Cybersecurity Club, Vice President</h4>
          <p>
            So far, my role entails planning and facilitating meetings. The task
            I enjoy most, however, is to listen and learn. Our club President
            has a lot of informative things to teach us!

          <h4>Computer Science Club, Treasurer</h4>
          <p>
            I took on this role recently due to a vacancy. I've lots to learn.
            My friend, who acts as Treasurer for other clubs, is teaching me.

          <h4>Competitive Programming Club, Member</h4>
          <p>
            I have gone to and competed in a few competitions in coordination
            with the club. We've attended PACISE, ICPC, and others. It is an
            amazing experience to solve a problem under stress!

          <h4>Music: Curating and Listening</h4>
          <p>
            While I don't make music, I certainly enjoy finding new music.
            Either from online or from other media like movies, music follows me
            everywhere. One of the things about the Internet of which I'm most
            grateful is the exposure to music I receive. Music in many
            languages, even when not understood by me, still sounds great.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've fallen in love with many genres throughout my life. One
            consistent genre "type" has been electronic music. My life with EM
            started with dubstep, but I soon grew out of the genre and move on
            to other things for a time. In late 2022, I stumbled upon a drum and
            bass musician named LTJ Bukem. Because of him, I now most enjoy
            jungle and drum and bass.
          </p>
          <p>
            More conventional genres such as rock, rap, R&amp;B, and pop have
            also enjoyed a special spot in my life. From the era of Jimi Hendrix
            to the decade of Nirvana, rock rocks! Also, rap and pop in not just
            English but also other languages (such as French rap or Russian pop)
            is something I frequently find myself listening to during the year.
            I must say that having just a little bit of curiosity when
            listening to music in other languages really helps you learn even
            basic words and phrases for fun.
